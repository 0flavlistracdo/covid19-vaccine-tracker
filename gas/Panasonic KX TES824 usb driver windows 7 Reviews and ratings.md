# How to Install Panasonic KX TES824 USB Driver on Windows 7
 
If you have a Panasonic KX TES824 PBX system and want to connect it to your Windows 7 computer via USB, you may encounter some difficulties finding and installing the right driver. The Panasonic KX TES824 USB driver is not officially supported by Panasonic or Microsoft for Windows 7, and the links to download it from third-party websites may be broken or unreliable. However, there are some possible solutions that you can try to make it work.
 
One option is to use the compatibility mode feature of Windows 7, which allows you to run programs or drivers that were designed for previous versions of Windows. To do this, you need to download the Panasonic KX TES824 USB driver for Windows Vista from the Panasonic website[^1^]. Then, follow these steps:
 
**Download Zip ::: [https://urlca.com/2uwQuv](https://urlca.com/2uwQuv)**


 
1. Right-click on the downloaded file and select Properties.
2. Click on the Compatibility tab and check the box that says "Run this program in compatibility mode for:".
3. Select Windows Vista from the drop-down menu and click OK.
4. Double-click on the file and follow the installation wizard.
5. Restart your computer and connect your Panasonic KX TES824 PBX system via USB.

Another option is to use the Windows XP Mode feature of Windows 7, which allows you to run a virtual version of Windows XP on your Windows 7 computer. To do this, you need to download and install Windows XP Mode and Windows Virtual PC from the Microsoft website[^2^]. Then, follow these steps:

1. Open Windows XP Mode and set up your virtual machine.
2. Download the Panasonic KX TES824 USB driver for Windows XP from the Panasonic website[^3^].
3. Install the driver on your virtual machine and connect your Panasonic KX TES824 PBX system via USB.
4. Enable USB integration between your virtual machine and your Windows 7 computer by clicking on the USB icon on the top menu bar of Windows XP Mode and selecting "Attach" for your device.

Both of these options may require some trial and error and may not work for every situation. If none of them work for you, you may have to consider upgrading your PBX system or using a different connection method. Alternatively, you can contact Panasonic or Microsoft for further assistance or look for other online resources that may offer more solutions.
  
The Panasonic KX TES824 PBX system is a versatile and affordable communication solution for small and medium businesses. It can support up to 8 CO lines and 24 extensions, and it offers various features such as DISA, caller ID, voice message, and modem. The system can also be connected to a computer via USB for programming and maintenance purposes.
 
However, connecting the Panasonic KX TES824 PBX system to a Windows 7 computer via USB can be challenging, as the driver for this device is not officially compatible with this operating system. This means that you may not be able to install the driver normally or use the Panasonic KX-TE Maintenance Console software to configure and manage your PBX system. This can limit your options and functionality of your communication system.
