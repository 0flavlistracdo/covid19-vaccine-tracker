## How to protect your Facebook password from hackers and scammers
 
While Facebook Password Decryptor can help you recover your password if you forget it, it can also be used by hackers and scammers to steal your login details and access your account without your permission. Therefore, you should take some precautions to protect your password and keep your account secure.
 
Here are some tips to follow:

- Don't use your Facebook password anywhere else online, and never share it with other people[^2^]. Your password should be different than the passwords you use to log in to other accounts, like your email or bank account.
- Create a strong password that will be difficult for others to guess[^1^] [^3^]. Ideally, your password should use a mixture of letters, numbers and symbols. Don't include your name or common words. Change your password frequently.
- Never click on suspicious links, even if they appear to come from a friend or a company you know[^2^]. Scammers may create fake websites that look like Facebook and ask you to log in with your email and password. Always check the website's URL before you enter your login information. When in doubt, type www.facebook.com into your browser to get to Facebook.
- Use two-factor authentication to add an extra layer of security to your account[^2^] [^4^]. This means that whenever you log in to Facebook from a new device or browser, you will need to enter a code that is sent to your phone or email, or use an app like Google Authenticator. This way, even if someone knows your password, they won't be able to access your account without the code.
- Log out of Facebook when you use a computer you share with other people[^2^]. If you forget, you can log out remotely from your security settings.
- Use a password manager to store your passwords securely[^3^]. There are many different applications that can generate and remember strong passwords for you. You only need to remember one master password to access them.

By following these tips, you can reduce the risk of losing your Facebook account to hackers and scammers. Remember, Facebook will never ask you for your password in an email or message. If you see anything suspicious on Facebook, report it. If you think your account has been hacked, follow these steps to secure it.
